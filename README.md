# Odin-Project--Etch-a-Sketch

## Project Overview

This is a challenge from Odin Project to create a etch-sketch project which is a 16 x 16 grid with a randomised hover background-colour affect which picks a random colour as the background as the mouse moves over each box. There is also user interface / interactiveness to change the grid dimensions to a maximum of 100 x 100. The container maintains the same dimensions regardless of number of items within the container. 

### Features
* Interctive drawing on customizable grid.
* Adjustable grid size for detailed or simple drawings. 

## Learnings
The main learning for this project were Javascript based. I already had a understanding of concepts used however, familiarity of using them and playing with them without having to do too much research. The main struggle in the project was trying to maintain square items within the container when the user had input new dimensions. This was achieved through Javascript function which calculated the length and width to maintain all squares were equal.
#### Main concepts used
* Randomised colour generator function
* Javascript DOM manipulation with creating an element and appending it to the container
* Utilising different event listeners such as mouseover, click and load.
